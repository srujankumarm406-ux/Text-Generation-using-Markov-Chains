# Prodigy InfoTech Generative AI Internship - Task 3

## Task Name
Text Generation using Markov Chains

## Objective
Implement a simple text generation algorithm using Markov Chains to predict the next word based on previous words.

## Description
In this project, a basic Markov Chain model is created to generate text. 
The model calculates the probability of a word occurring after another word based on input text data. 
Using these probabilities, new text sequences are generated.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Random module
- Dictionary data structure

## How It Works
1. The input text is split into words.
2. A dictionary is created to store word transitions.
3. The next word is selected randomly based on previous word probabilities.
4. A new sentence is generated using the Markov model.

## Example Input Text
"Artificial intelligence is the future of technology. 
Artificial intelligence is transforming the world."
